# Week 10: 3D Room

- 3D room with controllable cube character
- Models created using spline
- Initial idea: creating a simple interior decorating game where users can click and move furnitures -> changed to rpg style scene
- Potential change: detect object collision (struggled to use the raycaster as I imported the whole room/furnitures as one 3D object, referred to individual objects as child elements)
