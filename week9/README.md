# Week 9: Still Life

- Still life inspired by Wayne Thiebaud's clown cones
- Models created using spline
- Cartoon mesh used to give the piece a "flatter shadows" like in Thiebaud's pieces
- Potential change: add blue shadows (casted by ice cream / I tried doing this by setting cast shadow to true, but this led to the entire canvas turning black)
